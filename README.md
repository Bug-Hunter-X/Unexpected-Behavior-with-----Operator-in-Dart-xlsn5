This repository demonstrates an uncommon Dart bug related to the null-aware assignment operator (`??=`). The bug arises when using `??=` within a method that can be called multiple times, unintentionally modifying the variable's value beyond the initial null check. The solution shows how to correctly handle such cases by initializing the variable appropriately or using a different approach to achieve the desired behavior.
